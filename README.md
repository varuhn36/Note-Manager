# Note Manager
Note Manager is a place for you to store all your notes safely. You can create notes, update and delete them as you wish, and your notes can be accessed anywhere, as long as you have an internet connection!

# Landing, Login and Register Pages
When you first visit Note Manager, you will be brought here, where you can then login if you already have an account, or signup if you are new.
